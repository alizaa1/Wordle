# Wordle

🅰️ Wordle on FPGA — ECE241 Digital Systems Project

A hardware-implemented version of Wordle, built from scratch on the DE1-SoC FPGA using Verilog.
You type letters on a PS/2 keyboard, and the FPGA draws everything including tiles, letters, colors, win/lose screens, directly to a 640×480 VGA display.

✨ Project Highlights

- Full Wordle gameplay implemented as hardware modules
- Real-time VGA rendering with a custom sprite sheet
- PS/2 keyboard input handling
- Correct Wordle logic: green / yellow / gray feedback
- Hardware FSM controlling all display stages
- Win/Lose screens drawn using sprite ROM letters
- Fully synthesized and tested on the DE1-SoC board

🧠 System Architecture
🎨 Display System (VGA)
drawLetter — pulls pixels from a sprite ROM and draws each letter
drawTileColor — fills grid tiles with the correct colors
wordleDisplay — grid layout, coordinates, and plot timing
Display FSM — orchestrates drawing order
Sprite Sheet ROM — custom-designed letters

🎮 Game Logic
buffers - 5-letter guess buffer
compareWord - Comparison module (green/yellow/gray rules)
FSM - Win/Lose detection logic

⌨️ Input Handling
PS/2 keyboard interface
Event parser for letters, Backspace, Enter

🌟 My Contributions
Designed the entire VGA rendering pipeline
drawLetter
drawTileColor
VGA grid placement
Display FSM
Integrated the sprite sheet (letter ROM)

Built all tile coloring logic
Performed full on-board debugging (timing bugs, plot issues, grid misalignment)
Organized all Quartus project files
Created simulation testbenches (ModelSim) for display modules
Helped integrate top-level gameplay and display logic
Took lead on documentation + slides + final presentation
